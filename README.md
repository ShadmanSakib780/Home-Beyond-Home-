This is a website that I created for my final project for a web design class, BIS 13. I was inspired to create a website that would be used as an informative website/shopping site for different habitable planets. Of course, this is something that might potentially be a hundred or more years in the future targeting those audiences that would be looking to migrate to a different galaxy and world to turn a new leaf. In this project, I used HTML, CSS, as well as Javascript to create this website.
